# MAD-Chittr (React Native)
This is an assignment about developing a front end mobile application that can interface with a microblogging API using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

## Setup
Before starting to run the app, you will need to have:
- An android emulator ([Android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio))
- A few Command Prompt windows
- Follow the steps below

### Start up your Android Emulator
For the android emulator, I will suggest using Pixel 3 API28 with PlayStore to access most of the features.

### Installing packages
Open Command Prompt and change the directory to the MyApp directory.This project has several libraries installed, assuming your computer has [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, the dependencies will be installed in the local node_modules folder by running `npm install` in the Command Prompt.

### Start up the server
1. Open another Command Prompt, change the directory to the server code.
2. Run `npm install` to set up the dependencies in the server.
3. Run `npm start` to start the server. If the server is running you will see the output like:
```
Listening on port: 3333
```
**Side Note:** Remember to change the configuration in config.js located in the config folder.

### Test the server
1. Open yet another Command Prompt and also change the directory to the server code.
2. Run `npm test` to run the tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
3. There will be 3 errors shown at the result which is fine.
4. Close the Command Prompt and now the database is filled with some dummy data. :smiley:

### Run the app
1. Open the Command Prompt you used to install the dependencies for your app and run `npx react_native run_android` and wait for it to install in emulator and run the app.
2. If everything runs smoothly without any errors then Voil√†! You will be welcomed with the home screen.
